    <h1>Peloton tries to pedal its way back to the top through partnerships, acquisitions and a new CEO</h1>

    <p>Aime Thacker, a retired science middle school teacher and fitness enthusiast, bought a Peloton bike and a rower all in the span of 3 and a half years. She has been an active person since high school; playing a variety of sports, running marathons and trying out different gyms.</p>

    <p>“We have had several stationary bikes, rowers and treadmills and the quality compared to Peloton was like comparing a Ford Fiesta to a Mercedes-Benz,” said Thacker. “They’re quiet, they make absolutely no noise whatsoever and I like having access to the app for the classes, they’re very motivating.”
        
        Peloton benefitted from the infamous pandemic lockdowns of 2020. As gyms and studios were forced to shut down, fitness devotees had no choice but to turn to home workouts and equipment, spiking Peloton’s sales and app memberships.</p>

    <p>But their success was short-lived. Peloton amassed a loyal consumer base and while they boasted strong customer retention for a while, earnings data suggests their tight grip to attract and retain consumers is loosening. Since their peak during the pandemic, demand for Peloton hardware has weakened resulting in total revenue drops, year after year. On December 27, 2020, their shares closed at $163 but today, its stock does not trade above $10 per share. The future of the fitness company is at stake, with no clear direction amid constant guidance changes, has investors worried about the future of the company. 

        Without a path to driving meaningful revenue growth on its own, Peloton has stepped up its partnerships in an effort to drive hardware sales and attract new subscribers. Leaning on partnerships with other established brands may be the only path forward for the company. 
        
        “As the pandemic kind of subsided, people got out more, didn’t want to buy as much equipment and so it’s been rough for Peloton,” said Sanmeet Deo, senior investment analyst at The Motley Fool. “Barry McCarthy, who was the most recent chief executive officer, stepped down. He was trying to make it more of a subscription business versus just an equipment business. That proved challenging because it’s very competitive,” said Deo. 
        
        Peloton’s low churn rates have long been admired.
        
        “Luckily for Peloton, their membership remains quite attached,” said Pamela Rutledge, professor Emerita of Media Psychology at Fielding Graduate University. “Some of this must be attributed to the parasocial relationships members build with the instructor who reinforce the sense of personal agency and commitment from members by rewarding effort and outstanding production values which further enhances the sense of emotional connection and belonging.” 
        
        However, recent earnings data shows a dip in their paid subscriptions, which includes their paid connected fitness subscriptions and their paid app subscriptions. 
        
        This is bad news for the company. 
        
        According to Paul Golding, senior US payments and digital commerce analyst at Macquarie, subscriber and revenue overall are the baseline drivers of Peloton and they’re not meeting expectations.
        
        “Those drivers, the levels that they are expecting, imply a decline, continue to decline and so while the profitability and cash flow metrics, seemingly based on their forecasts, are improving, the baseline drivers are not,” said Golding. “Continued subscriber decline is expected and continued revenue decline is expected in their forecast that they are sharing with the Street.”
        
        Since 2022, many companies have expressed interest in acquiring Peloton, attracted by their low churn rates. 
        
        In February of 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported on Amazon’s interest to acquire Peloton, shooting up the exercise manufacturer’s shares by 30%. Then, in August of 2022, Peloton began selling its hardware, apparel and accessories on the e-commerce giant, which also increased its shares by 14%, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
        
        The same year, The Financial Times reported that the sneaker company, Nike, also considered acquiring Peloton before it went public in 2019. 
        
        Two years later, no acquisition has been made by either. 
        
        Most recently, at the end of December 2023, the investment adviser firm, Deepwater Asset Management released their 2024 predictions in which it forecasted Apple’s acquisition of Peloton. 
        
        “Peloton has a loyal subscriber base of about 3 million users that will add about $1.7B to Apple’s subscription revenue, additionally this fits well into Apple’s continued investment in health and wellness,” according to their 2024 predictions report. 
        
        In addition, back in May of this year, CNBC reported that sources familiar with the subject said that the pandemic darling could be going private. In the article, they also pointed out that previously, several private equity firms have expressed interest in acquiring Peloton.
        
        However, any agreement has yet to be announced. 
        
        On October 22 of 2024, Peloton announced a partnership with the retail giant, Costco, to sell its Bike+ at a discounted price in 300 of its US stores starting November 1 until February 15, 2025, or while supplies last.
        
        While this move boosted investor confidence, prompting Peloton’s stock to slightly jump, Peloton still has a long way to go to return to their pandemic levels of success. 
        
        Analysts hope that the installation of a new chief executive officer can help turn around the company.
        
        “As far as the stock, although it is up 38% since the 4QF24 report in August, we see the direction from here dependent on the appointment of a new CEO and the likelihood of ongoing and new initiatives to return the company to growth after three years of sales declines,” wrote in a research note the Telsey group.
